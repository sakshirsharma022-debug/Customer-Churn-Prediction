## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Handling class imbalance
= Model training and evaluation

## Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Evaluation
- Accuracy and ROC-AUC were used, with ROC-AUC prioritized due to class imbalance.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
